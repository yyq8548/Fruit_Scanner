# Development Log Update — Local RAG Food Knowledge Base

## Milestone
Added a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) layer for food storage and safety knowledge.

## What Changed
- Added `data/food_knowledge_base.json`
- Added `tools/rag.py`
- Added `RetrievalResult` to `AgentState`
- Updated `FruitScannerAgent` to retrieve relevant food knowledge before reasoning
- Updated `LLMReasoningTool` to include retrieved knowledge in the GPT prompt
- Updated Streamlit UI to display retrieved documents
- Added unit tests for retrieval behavior

## Why It Matters
The agent no longer relies only on the model prediction and generic LLM knowledge. It now retrieves relevant fruit-specific storage and food-safety facts before generating explanations and recommendations.

## Interview Framing
I added a lightweight local RAG layer that retrieves fruit-specific food safety and storage knowledge before LLM reasoning. This makes the assistant more grounded and prepares the architecture for future vector search, embeddings, or external knowledge sources.
